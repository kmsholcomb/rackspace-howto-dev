Archiving collects and stores both external and internal incoming and
outgoing email, including attachments. This data can be accessed for
search and review by the administrator of the account and by
administrator-designated users.

To enable archiving, [log in to the control
panel](https://apps.rackspace.com/?cp), and perform the following steps:

1.  Click **My account**.
2.  In the **Upgrade** section, click **Upgrade an existing domain**.
3.  If you have multiple domains, select the appropriate domain name. To
    change domains at any time, click **Change domain**.
4.  Under **Add-ons**, click the **Email Archiving** menu and select
    **Rackspace**.
5.  Click **Next Step**.
6.  Click **Complete Order**.

You will receive a welcome email from **mail@archivesrvr.com**. After
you receive the welcome email, all new email will start being copied
into the archive.

Messages will be indexed nightly for search purposes. To manually index
for immediate search access, click **Collect Now** in the **Collectors**
section of the Archive Manager.
