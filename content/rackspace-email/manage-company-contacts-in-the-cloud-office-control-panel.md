A company contact is different from an account administrator. A company
contact might or might not have administrative access to the control
panel. Unlike an account administrator, a secondary contact might
receive billing and renewal notices yet not be able to make changes to
the account. Use the following steps to add, edit, or delete a company
contact from your account.
