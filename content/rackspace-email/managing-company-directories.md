When you create a company directory, users in the directory have access
to up-to-date contact information for all users in the directory. Users
can access the company directory information through Webmail, via the
Contacts tab.

To view a company directory list, log into the control panel and perform
the following steps:


1.  Click on the **Go to section** drop-down menu and select **Rackspace
    Email**.

2.  In the **Collaboration** section, click the **Company
    Directory** link.


From here, you can add, edit, or delete an alias. See the instructions
below specific to the action you would like to take.



Adding/Editing a Company Directory:

-------------------------------------

1.  While viewing the **Company Directory** list, click on the name of
    the directory you want to edit. If creating a new directory, click
    **Add Directory**.

2.  Make changes as desired.

    -   Use the **Name** box to change or create the directory&rsquo;s name.

    -   To allow users to edit their personal contact information, check
        the **Allow users to edit their profile** box.

    -   In the **Domains** section, click once on a domain you want to
        add to the directory, and then click **Add**. Use
        the **Filter** or **Search** tools to locate a domain.

        **Note:** You can add several domains to the same directory, but
        each domain can belong to only one directory.

    -   To make changes to members, click the **Add/Remove
        Members** tab. Use the **Filter** or **Search** tools to locate
        the mailboxes you want to include, and then click **Add**.

        To add mailboxes that are outside your domain, type their email
        addresses in the **Add Members outside this Domain** box and
        click **Add**. Then, click on the newly listed email address and
        click on **Edit Contact Info**. Enter additional information as
        needed in the new window, and then click **Ok**.


3.  Click **Save**.



Deleting a Company Directory

------------------------------

1.  Select the check box next to each directory you want to delete. Or,
    to select all directories, select the check box that appears next to
    **Delete**.

2.  Click **Delete**.

3.  A pop-up box will appear to confirm that you want to delete
    the directory. Click **Delete (\#) company directory**.
