3\. If you have multiple domains, you may be prompted to select a domain
name. Or, to change domains at any time, click the **change domain**
link.

4\. Depending on the type of mailbox, click either the **Individual
Rackspace Email Mailbox** or **Individual Hosted Exchange Mailbox**
link.

5\. Click the user&rsquo;s mailbox name.

6\. In the **Settings** section, click the appropriate button to turn
spam filtering on or off. Or, click the **Exclusive** button to receive
email only from senders on the safelist.

7\. If you turned spam filtering on, indicate how messages should be
handled:


Rackspace Email Handling
------------------------

-   Deliver to Spam folder&mdash;Spam messages are sent to the user&rsquo;s
    Spam folder.

*Note: If you would like to automatically delete messages from this
folder, select the **Delete after \[    \] days or \[    \] total
email** check box and enter a specified number of days and/or total
emails.*

-   Delete the email immediately&mdash;Spam email will be deleted
    automatically and not delivered to the user's mailbox. Note: Email
    will be permanently deleted and will not be retrievable.

<!-- -->

-   Include "\[SPAM\]" at the beginning of the subject line&mdash;Spam email
    will be delivered to the user's Inbox, but will include the text
    "\[SPAM\]" in the Subject line.

<!-- -->

-   Deliver to the email address&mdash;Spam messages are sent to an address in
    your domain that you specify.

###

Exchange Handling
-----------------

-   Send spam to the quarantine for this recipient&mdash;Each Exchange mailbox
    has its own Quarantine Manager, located in the User Control Panel.
    (Note: Users can log into the User Control Panel at
    <https://cp.rackspace.com/usercp>, using their Exchange email
    address and password.) Email that is filtered as spam will be
    directed to the Quarantine Manager, where the user can then view and
    delete quarantined emails, or mark them as **Not Spam**.

<!-- -->

-   Send spam to domain quarantine&mdash;Spam will be directed to the
    domain-level quarantine, rather than to the individual Quarantine
    Manager for the mailbox.

*Note: To log into the domain-level Quarantine Manager, click the **Log
into the Quarantine Manager** link, located in the **Exchange Handling**
section of the entire domain spam settings page.) Email that is filtered
as spam will be directed to the domain-level Quarantine Manager, where
the administrator can then view and delete quarantined emails, or mark
them as **Not Spam**.*

-   Send quarantine notifications to&mdash;If you choose to send spam to the
    user's quarantine, they will receive quarantine updates by default.
    To receive email updates at an additional address, enter an email
    address in the **Send quarantine notifications to** box.

8\. Click the **Save** button.
