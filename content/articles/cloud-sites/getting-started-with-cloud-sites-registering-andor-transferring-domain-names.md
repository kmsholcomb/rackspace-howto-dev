[Getting Started with Cloud
Sites](/how-to/cloud-sites)

**Cloud Sites makes it easy for you to purchase a domain name directly
through the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel.** Below, we will go through
the process for [Registering a New Domain Name](#register_new_domain)
and [Transferring Your Existing Domain](#transfer_domain).



**Registering a New Domain Name**

**NOTE:** *If you are registering a new domain name through the Control
Panel, the DNS will automatically be setup for you to point to the
Rackspace Cloud.*<span> *Please see the "[What Top Level Domain
extensions can I purchase through the control
panel?"](/how-to/cloud-sites-faq)
article for a list of domain extensions available for purchase.*</span>

-   First, Log in to the [Rackspace Cloud Control
    Panel](http://manage.rackspacecloud.com)
-   Navigate to **Hosting-&gt;Cloud Sites**

<!-- -->

-   Click **Add a Site**
-   Select the correct **Site Owner** (usually "You")
-   Next, enter the domain name you want to purchase in the "Domain
    Name" text box (i.e. www.yourdomain.com)

    ![](http://c806394.r94.cf2.rackcdn.com/namesite.png)

<!-- -->

-   Choose the length of time for which you want to purchase the domain
    name

-   The next screen will allow you to review your new domain
    purchase order. If you are ready to purchase, then click **Finish**



**Transferring Your Existing Domain**

With Cloud Sites, you can transfer an existing .com, .net, .org, .us,
and .co.uk domain and receive an additional year of ownership for only
\$10.  By transferring your registrar, you will have all of your domain
information accessible in one place which makes it possible for us to
help you with the renewal of the domain name and other Support issues.

**NOTE:** *Transferring your existing domain does not automatically
update the DNS at the domain registrar level. You will need to manually
update your DNS if you would like to make your domain live on The
Rackspace Cloud.*

Follow these steps to transfer your existing domain name to Cloud Sites:

###### For a New Site:

-   Log in to the [Rackspace Cloud Control
    Panel](http://manage.rackspacecloud.com)
-   Navigate to **Hosting-&gt;Cloud Sites**

    <img src="https://8026b2e3760e2433679c-fffceaebb8c6ee053c935e8915a3fbe7.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/field/image/capture_1_0.png" width="179" height="287" />

<!-- -->

-   Click Add A Site and then enter the domain name in the **Domain
    Name** text box

    ![](http://c806394.r94.cf2.rackcdn.com/namesite.png)

<!-- -->

-   Check the **I already own/manage this domain name** check box
-   Select **Transfer the domain name** from the pull-down menu

    ![](http://c806394.r94.cf2.rackcdn.com/transferdomain.png)

<!-- -->

-   Click **Next Step**

<!-- -->

-   Last, you will review your order and click **Finish** once you are
    ready to process the order

**NOTE:** *Your current registrar may offer "transfer lock" or a similar
service as a security measure to prevent unauthorized transfer of your
domain name. If this feature is activated, you will need to log on to
your account with your current registrar in order to unlock the domain.
If you try to transfer a domain that still has the transfer lock
enabled, the transfer will be denied by your current registrar. In order
to turn the transfer lock function off, you must have access to the
administrative email address you used when first registering the domain.
Your current registrar will send an email to this account that will
require a reply from you, confirming that the transfer is authorized. If
you do not have access to this email address, contact [customer
support](http://www.rackspace.com/support/ "http://manage.rackspacecloud.com/SupportMain.do") for
help. You can do a WHOIS search to find the administrative email and the
current registrar for the domain.*

**NOTE:** *All DNS changes take up to 48 hours to take effect. During
this time you can check your website by [using the test
URL](/how-to/test-your-website-before-transferring-the-domain-name-to-cloud-sites)
(i.e. www.yourdomain.com.websitetestlink.com).*

###### For a Site Already in Your Control Panel

-   Log in to the [Rackspace Cloud Control
    Panel](http://manage.rackspacecloud.com)
-   Navigate to **Hosting-&gt;Cloud Sites**
-   Click the domain you wish to transfer
-   Click the DNS Tab

**<img src="https://8026b2e3760e2433679c-fffceaebb8c6ee053c935e8915a3fbe7.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/field/image/renewal.png" width="600" height="248" />**

-   <span>Click </span>**Transfer Domain**
-   <span>Review the Order Screen and Click </span>**Finish**

This concludes How to Register Your Domain and Domain Transfers. If at
any point you need additional assistance, please contact Support and a
Fanatical Racker will answer any questions you may have.
