The following article below will get your Microsoft Exchange email
account setup on your iPhone using the Activesync technology. Let's take
a look at the steps below to get you going:

*Note: Your device must be a **3G**, **3Gs**, and with a **4.0**+
**iOS**.*

1\. After your administrator has purchased an **Activesync** license and
assigned it to your email address, you'll want to log into your **User
Control Panel** at the following
URL: **[https://cp.rackspace.com/usercp](http://cp.rackspace.com/usercp)**

2\. Once you're logged in, scroll down to the **Client Setup** section
and click on the **ActiveSync** link. This will open the **Setting Up
ActiveSync** window which will contain the information needed to set up
your device.

3\. Once you have your **Setting Up ActiveSync** window open, tap the
**Settings** icon on the iPhone.

5\. The Exchange setup screen will open; you'll then enter the following
information:

-   Email - Enter your entire email address (e.g., myname@mydomain.com),
    using all lowercase letters.

<!-- -->

-   Domain - Enter the **Domain address** exactly as it is from the
    **Setting Up ActiveSync** window.

<!-- -->

-   Username - Enter the **User name** exactly as it is from the
    **Setting Up ActiveSync** window. The **User name** is different
    from the email address.

<!-- -->

-   Password - Enter in the password for your email account.

<!-- -->

-   Description - Enter a descriptive name for your account (e.g., My
    Work Account). This description will be visible only to you.

6\. Tap the **Next** button and the device will attempt to verify the
account. You may receive an "Unable to Verify Certificate message," go
ahead and Tap the **Accept** button.

7\. The device will than continue verifying the account. Once complete,
tap the **Server** field, and enter the **Server address** exactly as it
is from the **Setting Up ActiveSync** window.

8\. Tap the **Next** button and the device will then try to create a
secure (SSL) connection to your Exchange server. If it cannot do this,
it will try a non-SSL connection. If it asks for a confirmation, go
ahead and tap **Yes** to continue.

9\. Tap the **ON/OFF** buttons to select which information to synchronize
with the Exchange server and then tap the **Done** button when finished.

*Note: Your iPhone may take a moment to sync all your information
depending on how much you have on the Exchange server. To learn more
about the mail settings on your device tap Settings from the home
screen, than Mail, Contacts, & Calendars and than select your account.
You'll be able to customize how much data you would like to sync from
the server.*
