The following article below will get your Microsoft Exchange 2007 email
account setup on your Android Device using the Activesync technology.
Let's take a look at the following steps below to get you going:

*Note: The following article is a general guide for setting up all
Android devices. The steps may vary depending on the OS you're running.*

1\. After your administrator has purchased an **Activesync** license and
assigned it to your email address, you'll want to log into your **User
Control Panel** at the following
URL: **[https://cp.rackspace.com/usercp](http://cp.rackspace.com/usercp)**

2\. Once you're logged in, scroll down to the **Client Setup** section
and click on the **ActiveSync** link. This will open the **Setting Up
ActiveSync** window which will contain the information needed to set up
your device.

3\. Once you have your **Setting Up ActiveSync **window open, select
the **Settings** icon from the **Home** screen on your device.

4\. Next, select **Accounts and Sync **and then select **Microsoft
Exchange Activesync**.

5\. Next, enter your email address and password under the **Configure
exchange account in a few steps field**. Afterwards select the **Manual
setup** option.

*Note: Depending on what OS of Android you're running, if you have just
the "Domain" as an option, you may leave this field blank*.


6\. Next, enter the Domain address exactly as it appears from
the **Setting Up ActiveSync **window followed by a "\\" (backslash) with
the username exactly as it appears from the **Setting Up
ActiveSync **window. Then enter in your password and the Exchange
server exactly as it appears from the **Setting Up ActiveSync **window.

7\. On the following screen, select **OK**. Next, select all that apply
to you and on the last screen, give your account a name and you're
finished. Mail will start populating in your inbox if everything was
done correctly.
