The following article will help you setup your Microsoft Exchange 2013
email account with Mac Mail. Let's take a look at the steps below to get
you going:

*Note: Exchange 2013 only runs with the 10.6 or Above OS (operating
system). If you're unsure about what OS you're running, select the
**Apple** icon located in the top left hand corner and then **About This
Mac**.*

1.  Open Mac Mail and select File then **Add Account**.
2.  On the next screen enter in your Full Name, entire Email Address,
    and Password before clicking Continue.
3.  Enter the following information into the fields below:
    -   Account Type - Select **Exchange**
    -   Description - Enter in a descriptive name of your choice for
        your mail account (e.g., Work Mail).
    -   Incoming mail server - In the **Server address** field implement
        the following: *\***Find this in your Control Panel at
        cp.rackspace.com (for Admins) or User Control Panel at
        cp.rackspace.com/usercp under the Client Setup Section.***

    -   User Name - Enter in your entire email address
        (e.g., myname@mydomain.com)
    -   Password - Enter in the password associated with the email
        account you are setting up.

        *Note: The Address Book and iCal Calendar auto setup feature
        are optional.*

    -   Click the **Continue** button, and then click the
        **Create** button. Your account will then connect and mail data
        will begin to populate into your inbox.
