The following article will demonstrate how to create a Contact with
Microsoft Exchange. A Contact can be used to create an alias that will
forward to a mailbox hosted outside of your domain like Gmail or Yahoo.
Let's take a look at how to set this up:

1\. First thing you'll want to do is select **Manage Contacts** in the
Microsoft Exchange box.

*Note: If you have multiple domains you may be prompted to select a
domain name.*

3\. Next enter the name of the contact, the display name that will be
displayed in the Global Address Book, an email address and the external
email address that the email will route to and then select **Save**.

*Note: Check the **Hide from Global Address List** check box if you do
not want your contact visible in the Global Address Book.*
