The following article will demonstrate how to setup the BlackBerry
Enterprise Service (BES) with your Microsoft Exchange email account on
your mobile device. Let's take a look at the guide below:

*Note:* A BES data plan must be purchased through your provider and
added to your account; your administrator will then purchase a [BES
license](/how-to/add-an-activesync-or-bes-license) and
assign to your email address and provide you with an activation pin.

*Note:* *Some of the steps may vary depending on your OS (Operating
System). We've showcased OS5 & OS6 since they're the most commonly used
OS' at the moment.*

*Important Note: We are currently investigating BES10 and awaiting
official hosting guidance from Blackberry. Once we have this information
we will conduct testing to ensure our BES10 offering has the same
Fanatical Support you expect from Rackspace. To date, Blackberry has not
released an estimated date to distribute this information. In the
meantime, please feel free to continue using ActiveSync.*

the folder redirection changes have been saved. Your BlackBerry software
must be version 4.0 or higher.

**Menu** key (on older models), and select </span>**Options**<span>,
then </span>**Email Settings**<span>.</span>

Mailbox, press the Menu key and select </span>**Expand**<span>.</span>

<span>3. Highlight the folder you want to enable redirection on, press
the **Menu** key and select </span>**Change Option**<span>. Press the
**Menu** key and select **Save**.</span>

*Note:* *If you are unable to select Expand for any of the folders, or
if Change Option is unavailable, try turning Wireless Reconcile off and
then on again. You can find Wireless Reconcile in Messages &gt; Options
