Add folders to your public folders and assign permissions
---------------------------------------------------------

Following are instructions for creating additional public folders and
assigning permissions, as needed.

**Create a public folder**:

1.  Follow the steps in the preceding section to access your
    public folders.
2.  Right-click on your domain and select **New Folder**.

**Assign permissions to a public folder**

**Note**: You might see a few groups on the **Permissions** tab, and
that is normal. It is important to leave these groups intact so that we
can help you if you need help. There are also two special      groups
called **FolderAdmins** and **FolderUsers**. These groups allow you to
set permissions for all of your public folder administrators or users at
once.

1.  Follow the steps in the preceding section to access your public
    folders
2.  Right-click the public folder and select **Properties**.
3.  Click the **Permissions** tab.
4.  Click **Add**, select the member to whom you want to grant
    permission, and then click **Add**  again.
5.  Select the permission type for the user.
    -   **Owner**: Create, read, modify, and delete all items and files,
        and create subfolders. Folder owners can change the permission
        levels that other people have for the folder.
    -   **Publishing Editor**: Create, read, modify, and delete all
        items and files, and create subfolders.
    -   **Editor**: Create, read, modify, and delete all items
        and files.
    -   **Publishing Author**: Create and read items and files, create
        subfolders, and modify and delete items and files that
        you create.
    -   **Author**: Create and read items and files, and modify and
        delete items and files that you create.
    -   **Nonediting Author**: Create and read items and files, and
        delete items and files that you create.
    -   **Contributor**: Create items and files only.
    -   **Reviewer**: Read items and files only.
    -   **Custom**: Perform activities defined by the folder owner.
    -   **None**: You have no permission. You cannot open the folder.
