        the mailbox owner in the spaces provided (this is optional).

        the mailbox. This name will be displayed when the user sends
        email (this is optional).
    -   User Name: This will be the email address: E.g.
        myname@mydomain.com.
    -   Password: Enter a password for the email account. The password
        requirements are:
        -   Must be at least 8 characters
        -   Cannot include your username, display name, or full name
        -   Must contain 3 of the 4 character groups: uppercase
            characters, lowercase characters, numerals 0-9, or
            non-alphabetic characters (such as !, \$, \#, %). Example:
            Ex@mple1 is a valid password.
    -   Confirm the password by retyping the password you entered in the
        Password box.
    -   Microsoft Outlook license: This will allow the user to download
        Outlook from the user control
        panel (http://cp.rackspace.com/usercp).
    -   Public Folder Admin: This will give the user permission to
        create new and administer public folders they create.
    -   Select the **Save** button and the mailbox will appear in
        the list. To manage additional features for the mailbox, such as
        Forwarding / Auto-Reply, Aliases, or Settings, click the mailbox
        name and then click the corresponding tab.
