Support coverage for Rackspace Dedicated VMware vCloud is similar to
that of our other server virtualization products. Our virtualization
team maintains configurations and services in order to ensure server
uptime. With Dedicated vCloud, you can designate the service level for
virtual machines (VMs) as managed or unmanaged. Both service levels
include Rackspace support for the host infrastructure and virtualization
software. Managed VMs include additional support for the guest operating
system running on the VM. - \[Supported operations for managed
