### What's the difference between IMAP and POP?

The main difference between IMAP and POP is that IMAP works with email
directly on the server, while POP fetches mail from the server and works
with it on your local computer. For more information, see [IMAP and POP
mail protocol
comparison](/how-to/imap-and-pop-mail-protocol-comparison).

We strongly recommend using an IMAP connection with Rackspace Email.
