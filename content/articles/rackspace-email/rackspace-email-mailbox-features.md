### **Group Lists**

A group list is a great way to manage users in a select team or group on
your domain. There is no limit to the number of internal address
(addresses within your domain) and a limit of 250 additional members
outside of the domain. I.e. We have a billing team we would like to
group together, (bob@domain.com, amy@domain.com, scott@domain.com). We
will create a group list for the team to so they can communicate new
upcoming billing updates within the team, billingupdates@domain.com.

**Setting up a Group List**

To setup a Group List, log into the Admin Control
Panel [here](https://cp.rackspace.com/EmailHosting/Mail/GroupLists "here").



### Aliases

Aliases are a way to create an alternate name for an existing mailbox.
i.e. John likes to go by Johnny and would like to receive emails to both
John@domain.com, for business partners, and Johnny@domain.com, for
friends and familiy, without checking 2 different accounts.

**Settings up an Alias**

To setup an alias, log into the Admin Control Panel
[here](https://cp.rackspace.com/EmailHosting/Mail/Aliases/List.aspx "here").



### **Webmail**

Webmail is a direct connection to your E-mail without the need of
additional software. Accessing your E-mail account from webmail is very
beneficial, messages that are sent and received using Webmail will be
waiting for you the next time you log into the portal. The Webmail
portal provides most of the same funtionality a mail client would offer,
from sending/receiving email to setting up email signatures and even
setting up email forwarding to your personal E-Mail accounts.

**Webmail Vs. Mail Client**

-   There is no need to configure additional server settings
    for Webmail.
-   Email is ready to access 24/7 through the most popular web browsers
    (Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google
    Chrome, Safari)
-   Messages are stored in the cloud so no local storage is consumed.
