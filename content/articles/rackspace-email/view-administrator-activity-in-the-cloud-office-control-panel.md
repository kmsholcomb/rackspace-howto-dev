All administrator activity is logged. This activity includes logging in
to the control panel, changing administrators, and adjusting and logging
in to mailboxes. Administrator logs are available in the panel for the
months. To review these logs, log in to the [Cloud Office control
panel](https://apps.rackspace.com/?cp), and perform the following steps:

1.  At the top of the page, click **My Account**.
2.  In the **Administrators** section, click **Administrator Activity**.
3.  Filter by date, control panel area, or action.
4.  Click **Export List (.csv)** to export the administrator activity
    report as an Excel-compatible CSV file.
