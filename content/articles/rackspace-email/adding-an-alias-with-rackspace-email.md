The following article will cover how to create an alias that can be used
like a mailbox that will forward to another mailbox or to multiple
mailboxes on a domain. Let's take a look at how to set this up:

1\. Log in to your Cloud Office control panel. Once you're logged in
mouse over the **Go to** section drop-down menu and select **Rackspace
Email**.

**Members Inside This Domain** box select one or more mailboxes and
select **Add**. They will be added to the **Members Of This Alias** box.
