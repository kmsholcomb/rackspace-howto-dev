The Domain Name System is essentially the phonebook for the Internet. It
manages the relationships between IP addresses (the phone numbers), and
domains (individuals and corporations). All domains and their
components, such as mail servers, utilize DNS to resolve to the
appropriate locations.

For Cloud DNS, we have made available a public ReST API to interact with
our DNS infrastructure programatically. This will significantly help you
automate and simplify your domain management.
