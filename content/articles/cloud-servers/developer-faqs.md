### What is the developer+&trade; program?

developer+ is an introductory program for developers that enables them
to experience Fanatical Support&reg; and grow with Rackspace toward adoption
of the managed cloud.

The Service Level Rate and Service Level minimums are removed for
customers participating in the program. They are provided with an
infrastructure credit of \$50 a month for 12 months that covers a base
set of services. As with all Rackspace customers, participants in
developer+ are provided the following services at no charge: Cloud DNS,
Cloud Orchestration, Cloud Monitoring, Mailgun&trade; (first 50,000 emails
free), and Cloud Networking. Some support options in the customer portal
have been removed for developer+ customers, such as one-to-one chat,
support tickets, and the phone number. Tickets have been replaced with
Billing Inquiries.

As new products and services come online, they might be added to and
highlighted in this program.

Additionally, developer+ includes several direct feedback mechanisms as
part of the terms and conditions of signup that allow our teams to get
direct, honest feedback from customers. This feedback will enable us to
examine our offerings, documentation, user experience, and more.

### What is the difference between developer+&trade; and the Startup Program?

developer+ offers a way for developers who are comfortable writing and
deploying their code and require minimal assistance to use the Rackspace
Cloud

The Rackspace Startup Program offers discounted infrastructure as a
service and leverages Rackspace&rsquo;s knowledge and experience in the
business and technology communities to offer developing companies advice
on how to best architect their product. The Startup Program also
connects entrepreneurs to tools like ObjectRocket&trade; and Mailgun&trade;, and
gives them access to guidance on their startup through our extensive
network of startup and technology business professionals.

### How is developer+ identified in the different Service Levels?

Customers in the developer+&trade; program are a part of the Managed
Infrastructure service level, but have limited access to support Rackers
and have a customized self-service view.

Additionally, we offer developer-to-developer online support, which is
delivered to developers in a way they are used to and expect.
Developer-to-developer differs from online support only in scope and
location--it is still the exceptional customer experience delivered by
Fanatical Support that customers expect from Rackspace.

The following features are part of developer+:

-   An enriched developer portal, developer guides and a continually
    improved developer experience based on direct feedback
-   Rackspace Developer-to-Developer and troubleshooting support from
    our experts for your code leveraging our interfaces (APIs and SDKs)
-   IRC (join us in \#rackspace on irc.freenode.net)
-   StackOverflow Community Forums, email, Hacker News, and other online
    communities
    **Note:** Tickets filed are limited to billing only

### What if developers want to add another server? Test a website or database?

developer+ customers can consume cloud at a "pay for what you consume"
price for all services in any region at our adjusted infrastructure
prices. They can consume ObjectRocket&trade;, OnMetal&trade;--everything currently
available to our other customers.

### Can developers upgrade to another service level?

At any time, participants in the program may log into the Control Panel
and upgrade to our Managed Cloud service levels. Customers may not,
however, switch to developer+.

### How are developer+&trade; customers billed?

Customers in developer+ pay only for infrastructure they consume over
\$50 per month.

### Are developer+ customers eligiable for the SLA guarantees covered by Managed Infrastructure?

Yes, but their credit is reduced by 50 percent as noted in the Terms and
Conditions.
