### <span class="mw-headline">Host multiple websites</span>

Customers can manage multiple domains and websites on individual Cloud
Servers by utilizing name-based virtual hosting.

### <span class="mw-headline">Cloud burst</span>

Users can also provision infrastructure for average demand and use Cloud
Servers for overflow demand.

### <span class="mw-headline">High Performance computing</span>

High performance computing (HPC) requires enormous compute power.
However the compute tasks may not keep the computers busy all the time
in which case utilization of hardware is again low. With Cloud Servers,
HPC customers can reduce expenses by obtaining compute power only when
they need it and returning it back to the Cloud Server general pool when
it is not required.

### <span class="mw-headline">Delivering Software as a Service solutions</span>

Users can reduce datacenter expenses of hosting applications and
delivering it in the ASP (Application Service Provider) or SaaS
(Software as a Service) model.
