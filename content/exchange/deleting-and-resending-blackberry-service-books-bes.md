<span><span><span><span>Service books determine which services are
available on your BlackBerry&reg; device.  At times, the service books
become corrupt and will cause the Blackberry Enterprise Server (BES) to
fail upon synchronizing updates of PIM data such as Calendar or Address
Book entries. These issues are frequently resolved by deleting and
resending the service books to the device.  Please have the user delete
all service books starting with the &ldquo;Desktop&rdquo; from their Blackberry
device. Once completed, resend the service books from your Cloud Office
control panel</span><span>.</span></span></span></span>

<span><span><span><span>To delete the service books from the Blackberry
take the following steps:</span></span></span></span>
