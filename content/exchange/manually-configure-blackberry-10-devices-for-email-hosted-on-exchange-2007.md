The following steps are required to configure Microsoft Exchange 2007
ActiveSync on a Blackberry 10 Phone:

1\. After your administrator has purchased an Activesync license and
assigned it to your mailbox, you'll want to log into your User Control
Panel at the following URL: <https://admin.emailsrvr.com/usercp>

2. Once you're logged in, scroll down to the Client Setup section and
click on the ActiveSync link. This will open the Setting Up ActiveSync
window which will contain the information needed to set up your
device.

3. Locate the Settings options from within your home menu.
