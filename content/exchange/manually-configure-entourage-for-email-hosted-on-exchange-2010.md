The following article will help you setup your Microsoft Exchange 2010
email account with Microsoft Entourage. Let's take a look at the steps
below to get you going:

*Note:* <span>*Microsoft Exchange 2010 requires Entourage 2008 Web
Services Edition for full Exchange functionality. Entourage 2008 Web
Services Edition is a free add-on to Entourage 2008 provided by
Microsoft. You can find more information at the following
link:* </span><http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=10419>

<span>*If you cannot install the add-on, please consider using [Outlook
Web
Acess](/how-to/outlook-web-access-owa-for-exchange)
or setup your account using IMAP: [Help tool for hosted email and Skype
for
Business](/how-to/help-tool-for-hosted-email-and-skype-for-business)*</span>

1\. Open up Entourage and select **Tools**, **Accounts**, **New** and
then **Exchange**.

*Note*: *If the setup assistant window appears select Configure Account
