Welcome to Rackspace Cloud Office Control Panel! After you sign up for
Microsoft Exchanges services through Rackspace, the first thing you'll
want to do is log in to your Cloud Office Control Panel. This article
provides a brief overview of the control panel, which you can access at
<https://cp.rackspace.com/> for new Cloud Office customers or
[https://my.rackspace.com/]() for UK and MyRackspace customers.

### Control Panel Main

Once you're logged into the Control Panel, you will see a variety of
sections that showcase the products that you have signed up for (in this
case Microsoft Exchange). Each product/service box has a variety of
options and tools to choose from. Control Main includes **Microsoft
Exchange** Product box, **My
Account**, **Domains**, **Support **and **News & Alerts **window. As you
sign up for additional products (Microsoft Sharepoint, Cloud Drive) each
product will show up underneath to allow you to manage it directly from
the landing page.

The Microsoft Exchange section provides you with various options and
tools like spam filtering, creating distribution lists, and accessing

After you click **More**, new options appear, such as mobile messaging,
public folders, and the ability to upgrade your services by adding more
storage space to your mailboxes. We recommend getting familiar with all
the features so you can use the product to its full potential.
