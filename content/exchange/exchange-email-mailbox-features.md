### Lists

Lists, or Exchange Distribution Lists, are a great way to manage users
in a select team or group. Only e-mail address in your domain can be
part of a distribution List. For example, we have a billing team we
would like to group together, (bob@domain.com, amy@domain.com,
scott@domain.com). We will create a distribution list for the team so
they can communicate new upcoming billing updates within the team,
billingupdates@domain.com.

**Setting up a List**

To setup a List, log into the Admin Control Panel
[here](https://cp.rackspace.com/Exchange/Mail/Lists/ "here").[

### **Outlook Web App (OWA)**

The Outlook Web App is a direct connection to your E-mail without the
need of additional software. Accessing your E-mail account from OWA is
very beneficial, messages that are sent and received using OWA will be
waiting for you the next time you log into the portal. The OWA portal
provides most of the same funtionality a mail client would offer, from
sending/receiving email to setting up email signatures to even setting
rules to filter messages to sub-folders.

**OWA Vs. Mail Client**

-   There is no need to configure additional server settings for OWA.
-   Email is ready to access 24/7 through the most popular web browsers
    (Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google
    Chrome, Safari)
-   Messages are stored in the cloud so no local storage is consumed.
-   Changes made to Contacts, Calendar and Mail items are synced down to
    all other devices configured with your account.
