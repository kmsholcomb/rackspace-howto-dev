**NOTE:** This article refers to the [Cloud Sites Control
Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/). You can access this
interface from the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com/)
by clicking your username in the upper-right corner of the control panel
and selecting Cloud Sites Control Panel.

Raw logs are text files generated by your site that record information
about site visitors and what URLs they accessed.  They're in a standard
referred to as "combined log format", designed to be read by log
processors like web stats programs.

You can use the information in a raw log to help optimize your code to
reduce strain on your site and improve response times.  Raw logs can
also be useful in some troubleshooting situations.

Raw logs files can take up a lot of space. If you are not using them
 you may want to disable them to free up space for your account.

Once enabled the raw logs can be found in your domain's FTP directory,
in the "logs" folder.  You can determine the path to the domain using

root](/how-to/locate-the-linux-path-for-your-cloud-sites-website).
