    Status</span>**<span>, </span>**<span>Knowledge Base</span>**<span>,

-   **<span>Cloud Status</span>**<span> - Having a problem getting to
    the Control Panel, or any other Rackspace Cloud services?  The first
    place you should check is the Cloud Status page.  This is where we
    list all maintenances and service impacting events.  There is a
    different Status page for </span>**<span>Cloud
    Sites</span>**<span>, </span>**<span>Cloud Servers</span>**<span>,
    and </span>**<span>Email</span>**<span>.  This is because a
    maintenance or outage may only be impacting one product, while
    others remain unaffected.  </span>



-   **<span>Knowledge Base / Knowledge Center</span>**<span> - This
    valuable resource contains numerous articles, tutorials, videos,
    white papers, and webinars to help you find all available
    information on using the Rackspace Cloud.  How do we know it's
    valuable?  Because ***you are using it right now!***  You can get to
    the Knowledge Center directly by going to:
     </span>[<span>http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center</span>](/how-to/)
    <span>If you already know what you are looking for, the easiest way
    to find it is to enter keywords in the </span>***<span>How can we
    help?</span>***<span> bar at the top.</span>

-   **<span>Tickets</span>**<span> - the best way to communicate with
    our Support Technicians and provide specific details about a problem
    that you are experiencing is by opening a ticket.  The advantage of
    using a ticket is that it allows you to copy & paste or attach (20
    MB limit) cumbersome information such as traceroutes and error log
    entries directly into the ticket.  As you can imagine, trying to
    communicate this information over the phone is problematic at best.

-   **<span>Live Chat </span>**<span>- We have Support Technicians
    standing by 24 hours a day to answer any questions you have.  Under
    the Live Chat link, you will be directed into a Live Chat session
    with specialists trained to support our various products.  Choose
    the appropriate Live Chat link for the product you need
    assistance with.</span>

With all the support resources and support staff made available to you,
it's no wonder why Rackspace is known as the home of Fanatical Support!
