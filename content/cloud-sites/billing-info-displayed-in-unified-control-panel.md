 The Billing section of your existing control panel will be transitioned
into our new unified control panel. This is a first step towards
incorporating Cloud Sites into the unified control panel.

1\. **Why have my billing pages disappeared from the Cloud control
panel?**

Through this change, the Cloud Control Panel&rsquo;s access to credit cards
has been consolidated, and the billing pages have been moved to the
&lsquo;Rackspace Open Cloud Control Panel&rsquo;.

2\. **How do I access my billing pages?**

Click on the Billing link present under your account in the 'Cloud
Control Panel' (<https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/>)<span
style="line-height: 1.538em;"> and you will be taken to the billing
pages present in the &lsquo;Rackspace Open Cloud Control Panel'
(</span><https://mycloud.rackspace.com/>) <span
style="line-height: 1.538em;">where you will be able to perform all the
billing related activities. The Rackspace Open Cloud Control Panel will
open up in a new window or tab without closing your current
window.</span><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> </span>

3\. **How do I get back to the original Cloud Control Panel after I am
done with viewing the Billing pages?**

Once you close the current '<span
style="line-height: 1.538em;">Rackspace Open Cloud Control
Panel'</span><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> window, you should
have the &lsquo;Cloud Control Panel&rsquo; window open in your browser.</span>
