The Rackspace Cloud isn't afraid of the facts. And the fact is, audio
encoding is a good example of a task that a dedicated server is better
suited for. We built Cloud Sites to be a highly specialized and
optimized computer cluster for serving web content. That means it's not
really designed for audio processing or streaming tasks. It's okay to
have some audio content on Cloud Sites (if you own the copyrights, of
course), but it's not meant to be a processing farm for audio conversion
or a ShoutCast system to use for live audio streaming.
