legacy support only.

<span><span>If our spam filtering software suspects that an incoming
message is spam, it will be sent to the Spam folder. However, in some
cases spam messages may be delivered to your Inbox or some messages you
want to receive may be delivered to the Spam folder. You can customize
your spam filtering settings and level of filtering within
webmail.</span></span>

<span><span>To verify if spam filtering is enabled, please see [Is spam
filtering enabled on my email
accounts?](/how-to/manage-spam-filtering-for-your-cloud-sites-email-accounts "Is spam filtering enabled on my email accounts?")</span></span>

<span><span>**The Catch All Account:**</span></span>

<span><span>If you're account is configured to be the "catch all", then
spam will not be filtered and you will still see messages coming in as
\[SPAM\] even though you may have it set to do otherwise.</span></span>

<span><span>**Blacklisting Users/Domains:**</span></span>

<span><span>Email sent to you from domains, email addresses, and IPs on
your blacklist will be blocked and will not be delivered to your
mailbox. To manage your blacklist, do the following:</span></span>

1.  <span><span>Click the **Settings** link, located in the upper right
    corner of the webmail window.</span></span>
2.  <span><span>In the left pane, click **Spam Settings**.</span></span>
3.  <span><span>Click the **Blacklist** tab.</span></span>

list:**</span></span>

2.  <span><span>Enter a domain or email address in the space provided.
    Note: We recommend that you not blacklist domains from large email
    systems, such as hotmail.com or yahoo.com, as this could prevent you
    from receiving legitimate email. Also, you can use a "%" as a
    wildcard in the domain or email address (For
    example: @%.ru).</span></span>

1.  <span><span>Click the **Add** button.</span></span>

    can use a "%" as a wildcard in the last three octets to specify
    IP ranges. For example: 216.12.34.%, 216.12.%.%, and 216.%.%.% are
    all valid ranges.</span></span>
3.  <span><span>Click the **Add** button.</span></span>

<span><span>**Adding users/domains to your Safelist:**</span></span>

    corner of the webmail window.</span></span>

    wildcard in the domain or email address (For

changes you make to your spam filtering preferences will be in effect

Mail, Eudora, etc., your spam will be filtered, according to your
preferences, before the email reaches your inbox.</span></span>

    corner of the webmail window.</span></span>

<span><span>In the **Spam Filtering** section, you can turn spam
filtering on or off. Or, you can turn on the **Exclusive** setting,
which will allow you to receive incoming email only from addresses or
IPs on your safelist. For more information about safelists, please see
the specific topics related to safelists.</span></span>

how you want spam to be handled. In the **Spam Handling** section,

    email messages, whichever occurs first.</span></span>

    want your spam messages delivered to the Spam folder, but you do not
    want spam messages automatically deleted.</span></span>

2.  <span><span>Delete the email immediately&mdash;Spam email will be
    deleted automatically.</span></span>
