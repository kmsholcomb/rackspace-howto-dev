A domain&rsquo;s WHOIS record can include various types of information for the
domains you own. When a WHOIS search is performed, you can discover when
and by whom a specific domain was registered, the domain contact
information, and whole lot more. If Rackspace is your domain&rsquo;s
registrar, you can manage your domain&rsquo;s WHOIS information through the
control panel; let's take a look at some steps to see how this is
done: ***Note: **The information you provide will be visible to anyone
who searches the Internet for your domain&rsquo;s WHOIS record.*

1\. First thing you'll want to do is [log into your control
panel](http://cp.rackspace.com), mouse over the **Go to
section** drop-down menu and select **Domains**.
